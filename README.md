Project Name: Five Animations From Kyoto Animation

Project Description: Kyoto Animation is very famous for its fantastic animation production. Their stories and drawing amazed many of the audience. It is certainly a pleasure to watch the companyâ€™s work. I believe that it will be good to promote the animations to people all around the world so as to share the beauty of the animation.

On the other hand, the animation from Kyoto Animation always introduce positive attitudes towards life. Audience appreciate them a lot so animation itself can be a tool for educating people. They can teach people meaningful concepts such as faith, love and courage. 

Some people even tell joke about Otaku(people obsessed with anime) will not commit suicide because they have to keep on watching animation. Through introducing excellent masterpieces from Kyoto Animation, young adults may develop an interest of watching animation and learn the things that they cannot get in school lessons.
